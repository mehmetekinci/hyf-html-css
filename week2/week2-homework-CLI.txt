1. Research how to create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command.

Answer:
       $ touch emptyfile.txt
       $ mv emptyfile.txt .emptyfile.txt
       $ ls -a

2. Research how to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command.
E.g. How would you create 'fun' directory along with all directories in the path below:
/c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

Answer:
       $ cd 
       $ pwd
       $ /c/Users/unmesh
       $ mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun       

3. Execute following commands terminal:
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
wc -c fun

Verify number of characters in the file. 

Answer:
        The system detects also space and transition to other lines as a character.
        The system says 18 chracters but there are 15 letters, 1 space and 2 enter
        effect. When you use 'echo' command, the cursor jumps next line. It means, 
        with every overwrite starts new line.
        
        

4. Research how to append something in the file *WITHOUT* a newline character.
E.g.
echo "test" > fun
echo "another test" >> fun
cat fun
Output of "cat fun" is
test
another test

How would you use echo command, so that output would be:
testanother test

Answer:
       $ echo -n "test" > fun 
       $ echo -n "another test" > fun
       $ cat fun
        Output
       $ testanother test
